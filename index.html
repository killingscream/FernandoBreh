    <p>From 6th grade to 9th I had a best friend we would do everything together but then when 9th grade came everything changed even for her
    she started doing bad stuff and ditched class so I stopped talking to her. The only thing I remember about her is the movie we made together about bullying because that's what we had both in common</p>
